# Technology: Clearly Explained

<p class="title">Blog Posts / Website Copy / Documentation / Technical Writing</p>

<div class="narrow" markdown="1">

My background is in technology. I have been designing applications and building on the web for over fifteen years. My degree is in English, and I enjoy concise, easy-to-understand writing.

		<h2>Have a technical topic you need to explain?</h2>
		<h2>Want a clearly written how-to?</h2>

### The Game Plan

1. Learn about your audience. Who they are and what they want.
1. Understand the tone you want to project.
1. Identify your goal. Are we educating or persuading? What does a win look like?
1. Write the piece. Edit it. Get your feedback. Revise it. Repeat until you are happy.
1. Promote the post on social media and [my blog](/posts/). *(Unless I ghostwrite it for you.)*

### Pricing

<span class="type">**Base Rate**</span>		  <span class="rate">15¢ a word</span>   <span class="total">$105 for 700 words, $150 for 1,000</span>  
<span class="type">**Highly Technical**</span> <span class="rate">30¢ a word </span>  <span class="total">$210 for 700 words, $300 for 1,000</span>

What is a highly technical topic? It's fairly subjective, but <a href="#contact" class="cta">we’ll start with a conversation</a> and agree on a price up front. If you’d prefer an hourly or project rate, we can work that way, too.


### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

If you are blogging as part of a content marketing strategy, SEO is an important consideration. I have a good grasp of the basics. For example, [this post](/posts/presenting-mulitple-design-options) currently ranks second on google for the search “[presenting multiple design options](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=presenting%20multiple%20design%20options).”

I can’t promise that your post will be on the first page of results. There are a lot of factors that influence ranking, many outside of our control. But I will work to make your post rank as highly as possible. And I understand which details matter most.
