Ever since Donald Trump was elected president, I have been waiting for some youth culture rebellion, some new kind of punk rock, to rise up. I mean, all the punks were pissed at Ronald Reagan in the 80's, right? Reagan is really weak tea compared to Trump.

I kinda figured it would be a form of hip hop, this time. *(And truth be told, this is likely [the new punk rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYOjWnS4cMY).)*

But for my money, the band bringing the new punk rock are the [Idles](https://www.idlesband.com).

These three songs, "Never Fight A Man With A Perm", "Mercedes Marxist" and "I'm Scum" are a good intro to the band. I prefer this live version of "Never Fight A Man With A Perm", but [the official video if a ton o' fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEe4i2osF5A).

The songs "Never Fight A Man With A Perm"and "I'm Scum" are off their latest full length album [Joy as an Act of Resistance](https://idlesband.bandcamp.com/album/joy-as-an-act-of-resistance). Their latest release is the EP, Mercedes Marxist

This song is also from Joy as an Act of Resistance, and it got a fair amount of press, because while they look and sound a bit like hooligans, the lyrics are decidedly progressive:

My blood brother is an immigrant  
A beautiful immigrant  
My blood brother's Freddie Mercury  
A Nigerian mother of three
