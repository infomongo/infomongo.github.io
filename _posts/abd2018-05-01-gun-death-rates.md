The data on gun deaths comes from the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation][guns], at the University of Washington. It excludes suicides and deaths from war or other “armed conflicts.” These are gun deaths that were investigated as crimes, or should have been. Figures listed are from 2016.

## U.S. & Western Europe

<div >

</div>

You have seen likely some variation of this graph before. It compares the death rates of Western Europe with those in the United states. It shows the number of deaths per 100,000 people. 

Western Europe is a bit hazily defined. The chart shows nine representative countries, including the highest death rate (Portugal) and the lowest (the UK). 

The industrialized wealthy countries of Europe have some of the rates of gun violence, and deaths from gun violence, in the world.

The U.S. has a lot in common with these countries. We are also a wealthy, industrialized nation. We have a higher average income. We also have high levels of income inequality.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
|Netherlands | $50,898.1 | 30.3 |
| Austria | $50,077.8 | 29.2 |
| Germany | $48,729.6 | 27.0 |
| Finland	| $43,052.7| 21.5 |
| United Kingdom | $42,608.9 | 32.4 |
| France | $41,466.3 | 29.5 |
| Italy | $38,160.7 | 31.9 |
| Spain | $36,309.8| 35.9 |
|Portugal | $30,624.2| 33.9 |

The data on income is from the [World Bank][income] and is based on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. This data is from 2016, although the less developed countries may use older data.

[income]: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD

The income data is an average.  It’s calculated by taking a country’s GDP, adjusting it by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) and dividing by the population.  PPP is a way to adjust the values to account for local differences in the cost of living, inflation and the like. *(The values are shown in 2011 international dollars.)*

The [Gini coefficient][gini-def] data is also [from the World Bank][gini-wb], backfilled with [data from the CIA World Factbook][gini-cia].  It’s a measure of income inequality, expressed as a number from 0 to 100. In a mythical country where everyone has the exact same income, the Gini index would be 0. This is maximum income equality. In a country where one person has all the money and everybody else has nothing, the Gini index would be 100, representing maximum inequality. 

Finland has the lowest income inequality in the word, with a Gini index of 21.5.

## North & Central America

<div >
	<img src="/img/america.svg" class="full-width">
</div>

This graph shows how the U.S. compares to our neighbors in North & Central America. These two regions have the highest rates of gun deaths in the world. 

Canada is the outlier here. The rate of gun violence is on par with the highest rates in Western Europe.

El Salvador has the highest rate of gun deaths in the world. Again, this data isn’t counting deaths from armed conflicts. Of the counties that are not having a war, El Salvador has the highest rate of gun deaths.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
| Canada | $44,819 | 32.1 |
| Panama | $23,008 | 50.4 |
| Mexico | $17,274 | 43.4 |
| Costa Rica | $16,609 | 48.7 |
| El Salvador | $8,616 | 40.0 |
| Belize | $8,461 | - - |
| Guatemala | $7,944 | 53.0 |
| Nicaragua | $5,539 | 47.1 |
| Honduras | $4,736 | 50.0 |


Most of these countries are a lot poorer that the U.S, but they have similar levels of income inequality. Again, except for Canada which has rates similar to Western Europe.

## South America

<div >
	<img src="/img/south-america.svg" class="full-width">
</div>


The chart omits the Guyanas, with rate of 8.86 gun deaths per 100,000.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
| Chile | $23,194 | 50.5  |
| Uruguay | $21,619 | 39.7 |
| Argentina | $19,939 | 42.4 |
| Brazil | $15,123 | 49.7  |
| Colombia | $14,153 | 50.8 |
| Peru | $13,018 |  43.8 | 
| Ecuador | $11,128 | 45.0  |
| Paraguay | $9,567 | 47.9 |
| Venezuela | $9,340 | 39.0 |
| Bolivia | $7,234 | 44.6 |

Bolivia is a much poorer country, but has very similar levels of gun death to the United States. 

## The Caribbean

<div >
	<img src="/img/caribbean.svg" class="full-width">
</div>

American Samoa and the US Virgin Islands are US Territories. The US Virgin Islands has the highest rate of gun deaths in the Caribbean, while American Samoa has one of the lowest.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
| Bermuda | $26,210 | --|
| Antigua and Barbuda | $22,661 | -- |
| The Bahamas | $22,516 | -- |
| Dominican Republic | $15,204 | 45.3 |
| Jamaica | $8,821 | 45.5  |
| Haiti | $1,783 | 60.8  |
| Cuba | -- | -- |
| America Samoa | -- | -- |
| U.S. Virgin Islands | -- | -- |

Haiti, a very poor country, has about the same rate of gun deaths as the U.S.

## The Middle East

<div >
	<img src="/img/middle-east.svg" class="full-width">
</div>

The rates of gun death are much lower in the Middle East than in the western hemisphere. These statistics omit deaths due to armed conflict.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| Qatar | $127,480 | --  |
| Kuwait | $74,264 | --  |
| United Arab Emirates | $72,399 | --  |
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
| Saudi Arabia | $54,416 | 45.9  |
| Israel | $37,258| 36.3  |
| Iran | $19,948 | 44.5  |
| Iraq | $17,348 | -- |
| Pakistan | $5,235 | 30.7  |
| Afghanistan | $1,944 | --  |

Interesting that there is no Gini data for the richest countries in the region. Also, note the average income levels for the richest countries. 


## Sub-Saharan Africa 

<div >
	<img src="/img/africa.svg" class="full-width">
</div>

The countries shown are representative of the region, including the three with the highest levels of deaths and the country with the lowest.

| Country | Income | Gini |
|---|---|---|
| United States | $57,638 | 41.5 |
| South Africa | $13,196 | 62.5 |
| Cape Verde | $6,551 | --  |
| Nigeria | $5,861 | 48.8 |
| Lesotho | $2,951 | 63.2 |
| Guinea | $1,966 | 39.4 |
| Rwanada | $1,912 | 46.8 |
| Uganda | $1,819 | 39.5 |
| Ethiopia | $1,734 | 33.0  |
| Burundi | $777 | 42.4 |

Lesotho and South Africa has the highest rates of income inequality in the world. This data is from the [CIA World Factbook] and the figure for Lesotho is from 1995 and South Africa from 2013. They also have high rates of 

Cape Verde is an archipelago of islands off the West coast of Africa. Its location made it an ideal staging ground for Atlantic the slave trade during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It is one of the more developed countries in Africa.

Rwanda and Burundi have few natural resources and most of the population survive via subsistence farming. They are small countries. Together they cover an area about the same size as southern Florida, from Tampa down to Miami.

Guinea is a small country on the West coast of Africa, near Sierra Leone and Liberia.  It has large reserves of  bauxite and iron ore, as well as diamonds, gold, and other metals. Three quarters of the population work in agriculture.

## What Conclusions Can We Reach?

Among the richer industrial counties, the United States is an outlier. Our rates of death from guns are not found anywhere else in the industrialized world.

The Western hemisphere is much more violent that other parts of the world. However, Canada’s rates of gun death look more like Europe. Canada's  income inequality, social safety net and healthcare are also more similar to Europe.

Counties involved in the international drug trade have higher rates of firearm deaths, including most of Central and South America. Afghanistan is the world largest producer of opium, and it is a violent and dangerous place, even without counting the deaths from the conflict we have been involved with since 2001.

As far as gun deaths, here is the neighborhood we live in:

| Country | Rate of Gun Deaths |
|---|---|
| Argentina | 3.37 per 100 K |
| Bolivia | 3.73 per 100 K |
| United States | 3.85 per 100 K | 
| Haiti | 3.90 per 100 K |
| Iraq | 4.28 per 100 K |

Looking at this data at the country level is somewhat misleading. Deaths from gun violence are higher in cities than in rural areas. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation provides data at the state level, but not down to the city level, with the exception of the District of Columbia.

| State | Rate of Gun Deaths |
|---|---|
| Vermont | 2.07 per 100 K |
| Colorado | 2.52 per 100 K |
| California | 3.56 per 100 K | 
| Illinois | 4.45 per 100 K |
| District of Columbia | 9.00 per 100 K |

It would be interesting to look at the data at the city level. The city of Chicago is likley the why Illinois has a higher rate than the national average.
