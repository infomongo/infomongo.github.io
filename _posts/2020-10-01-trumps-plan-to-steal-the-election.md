This article in The Atlantic, [The Election That Could Break America][atl], crystalized some of my thoughts. Initially, I thought Trump was simply trying to undermine our faith in the election, to excuse a defeat. But now, I think he has a plan to steal the election.

## Step 1: Politicize mail-in voting

Trump has tweeted continuously about vote-by-mail leading to “massive fraud.” There is no evidence supporting this, but he has successfully politicized mail-in voting. [53% of Biden supporters plan to vote by mail. 57% of Trump supporters say they’ll vote in person][ap].

## Step 2: Suppress the vote

Just today, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a proclamation that limits mail ballot drop-off locations to one per county. Harris County, population 4,092,459, includes the Houston area, and typically votes Democratic. It the most populous county in the state, and third most populous in the county, and now it is limited to a single drop-off location. This is a cynical attempt to suppress Democratic votes by a Republican governor.

In the first debate, Trump said “bad things happen in Philadelphia” and he urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully.” Earlier that day, Trump campaign staff were [blocked by local officials][phi] from monitoring newly opened election offices. Philadelphia law requires poll watchers to have a certificate issued by the city, and none have been issued yet, because the city does not consider these offices to be polling places. They allow people to register to vote, and request or return mail-in ballots.

In response, Thea McDonald, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, said “Democrats have proven their lack of trustworthiness time and again this election cycle.” Neither McDonald nor Trump provided any evidence of Democratic wrong-doing.

It's the Republicans who have proven untrustworthy. [For 35 years, the Republican National Committee operated under a "consent decree"][vote] to limit voter suppression, until it was lifted in 2018. Before the decree, the RNC hired off-duty cops to patrol minority precincts, wearing “National Ballot Security Task Force” armbands. Then as now, the excuse for this "ballot security."

What will happen if Trump calls for the “Proud Boys” or some other armed white-nationalist militia to “monitor the polls” in majority Black precincts? Or barring that, maybe order the Justice Department to deploy unmarked troops, as they did in Portland, to “secure the election.” The closer we get to the election, with Trump trailing Biden, the more desperate he will get. I wouldn't rule anything out.

## Step 3: Declare victory on election night

With more Trump supporters voting in person, the President expects to be leading on the night. Many states will have much higher than usual number of mail-ballots to process, and  will likely be slow to count them. Some states have laws that prevent them from processing ballots until election day. With more Trump supporters voting in person, and counted in the “normal” way, this increases the odds that Trump will have a lead on election night. Any election day voter suppression will aid this effort. 

## Step 4: Contest votes tallied after election night

In any election, some votes are counted after election day. The late-reporting precincts, un­processed absentee votes, and provisional ballots have to be counted. For the last 20 years, votes tallied after election night have tended to favor Democrats. 

In Arizona, Republican Martha McSally had a lead of 15,403 votes on the morning after the election in 2018. But the Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, ended up winning by 71,303 votes after all the votes were tallied. That same year both the governor’s race and the senate race in Florida were close enough to trigger automatic recounts. Both Republicans, Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott, had leads that narrowed during the recount, but both were eventually elected.

On November 12th, while votes were still be tallied in Florida, [Trump tweeted][twt]:

#### “The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!”

That’s his strategy for 2020. Declare without evidence that legitimate ballots tallied after election night are “new” and “forged”, and try to exclude them.

## Step 5: Target mail-in ballots

With more Democrats voting by mail, expect Trump to target mail-in ballots for disqualification. In fact, it’s already happening. 

[The Trump campaign sued Pennsylvania in federal court][naked]. One of the issues they raised was about “naked ballots”. According to the instructions, a completed ballot should be put in a “secrecy envelope” that has no identifying information, and then into a larger mailing envelope that the voter signs. Naked ballots are those that don’t have the secrecy envelope.

The state Supreme Court in Pennsylvania ruled that these ballots won’t be counted. Nobody knows how many naked ballots will be thrown out, but it could be as high as 5%. All this in a state Trump carried by about 44,000 votes in 2016, less than 1% of the total vote.

## Step 6: Fight in court

Trump won’t concede. Only losers concede. So rather than a peaceful transfer of power, expect a court fight. Expect it to center on mail-in ballots, because those are more likely to be votes for Biden. Expect dirty tricks, because that is his best and maybe only chance of winning.

## What to do about this?

I’m not sure what actions we should be taking. 

I’m glad I live in Colorado, where we have universal vote-by-mail. Every registered voter is mailed a ballot in early October. These can be returned by mail, placed in a drop-off box, or handed to an election judge at a drive-thru drop-off. And if you lose you ballot, make a mistake, or just want to vote in person, you can go to polling place on election day. [More about voting by mail in Colorado][co]
