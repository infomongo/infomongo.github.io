I'm taking a break from social media. I hadn't looked at facebook in 6 to 9 months, so I disabled my account. I deleted the twitter app on my phone, and we'll see if I can make this stick. Really trying to avoid any apps that I open just to kill time. More on this in a future post.

One of the only useful things twitter was offering me was a **UX and Web Design** section in the search tab. This was a good way stay abreast of industry developments. But, it's kinda like swimming thru a cesspool to get an oreo cookie.
