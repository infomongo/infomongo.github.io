I like my neighborhood. We have been living in Sunnyside since 2001. But it used to be a lot more diverse.

So in the spirit of "Keep Austin Wierd" and "Keep Portland Weird" I created this yard sign. I've had some interest, so here's [a link to the PDF](/img/Keep-Sunnyside-Sketchy.pdf). 

It's not the most print-friendly PDF ever created. It's RGB and it's pretty small, but it's a vector image, and I converted the font to outlines. If you want to use it, feel free.
