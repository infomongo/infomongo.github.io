At a Fox News Virtual Town Hall on March 24, the President said:

<div class="lite" markdown="1">
"I don’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself — the problem being, obviously, the problem.  And you know, you can destroy a country this way, by closing it down, where it literally goes from being the most prosperous — I mean, we had the best economy in the history of our country three weeks ago.  And then all of a sudden, we’re supposed to shut it down."

I find this point of view troubling. **Either we save lives, or we save the economy**. But, this is America. We can dance and chew gum at the same time. **We can do both. We have to do both**. 

Later in the town hall, he said:

<div class="lite" markdown="1">

"Well, you have to make the decision.  Look, we lose thousands — I brought some numbers here.  We lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu.  We don’t turn the country off — I mean, every year.

Now, when I heard the number — you know we average 37,000 people a year.  Can you believe that?  And actually, this year we’re having a bad flu season.  But we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off."

## This is scary & wrong

The economy can recover. **The dead will not**. And it ignores some basic facts:

- **This virus is more contagious than the flu**. We have no immunity to it. And it looks like initially people are infected, but symptom free. So they spread it without knowing.

- **This virus is much deadlier than the flu**. For the 2016-17 flu season, the CDC estimates there were 29,000,000 cases and 38,000 deaths. That's a death rate of 0.13%. [source](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html)

- The WHO reports 375,498 cases and 16,362 deaths worldwide. **That’s a death rate of 4.36%.** [source](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd )

If the same 29,000,000 Americans catch this virus, here's how many deaths we are talking about:

- at 4% that's **1,160,000 deaths**
- at 2% it's **580,000 deaths**
- at 1% that's **290,000 deaths**

More than 29,000,000 americans may catch it, because we have no immunity or vaccine.

## What is the actual death rate?

South Korea has reported 9,137 cases and 126 deaths, **a death rate of 1.38%.** They achieved this by testing everyone, and isolating the infected. 

Italy has 74,386 cases, 7,503 deaths and **a death rate of 10.09%**. They did not control the spread, and hospitals got overwhelmed.

In the U.S, so far we have 60,653 cases and 819 deaths, a **death rate of 1.35%**. And it's early days, it's still spreading. 

We don't have a treatment, yet. We don't have a vaccination. All we have is containment, using the blunt instrument of "social distancing".

We have to demand that our government protect us. And we have to use data to decide when to "end the shutdown". 

Please hold your representatives feet to the fire. We need to stay inside and slow the spread. [Please call your Senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?State=CO), and demand they protect us. Demand that the government take this seriously, and focus on saving lives.
