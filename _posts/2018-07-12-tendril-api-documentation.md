I worked with [Tendril](https://www.tendrilinc.com) to launch a site documenting a collection of their APIs at [tendril.readme.io](https://tendril.readme.io).

I wrote the documentation and helped them choose [readme.io](https://readme.io) to host the site.

We went with readme.io because it offers a good mix of features (documentation,  API explorer, and discussion groups) and itâ€™s integrated with Swagger. *Swagger integration was important to the team*. The [API Explorer](https://tendril.readme.io/v1.0/reference) section is created automatically when you import a `swagger.yaml` file that describes the API.

I have been doing more technical writing lately and really enjoying it. Reach out if you need some help.
