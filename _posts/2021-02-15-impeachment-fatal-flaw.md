As I write this, it’s February 13th, 2021. It’s °4 F and snowing lightly here in Denver. The Senate has just found Trump not guilty of Incitement of Insurrection, the single charge put forward in his second impeachment. 

The final tally was 57 guilty votes to 43 not guilty. All 50 Democrats voted for impeachment. They were joined by Republicans Richard Burr from North Carolina, Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, Susan Collins from Maine, Lisa Murkowski from Alaska, Mitt Romney from Utah, Ben Sasse from Nebraska and Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania. Impeachment requires two-thirds of the members, or 67 votes with all 100 present.

I have feelings about this, that I’ll detail in a future post, but this is the **most bipartisan impeachment vote in history**. 

## The Fatal Flaw

There are only seven people in history who have voted to impeach a President from their own party, the seven who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment. Mitt Romney was previously the only Senator ever to vote to impeach a President from his own party.

The fatal flaw in impeachment is the idea of an impartial jury made of Senators, many from the Presidents’s own party. There is no impartiality. There isn’t even a pretense. 

The January 6 Insurrection was driven by the **“big lie”** that Trump won the election. Trump repeated this ad nauseum between the election and the coup attempt. This lie was also spread by numerous GOP Senators. 

On January 6th, after the violence, there were objections to counting the electoral college votes of both Arizona and Pennsylvania. *(The intial objection to Arizona took place during the attack, but both Senate votes below took place after they reconvened.)*

* Objecting to Arizona’s vote were Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), John Kennedy (R-LA), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), and Roger Marshall (R-KS). 

* Objecting to Pennsylvania’s vote were Senators Ted Cruz (R-TX), Josh Hawley (R-MO), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Rick Scott (FL), Roger Marshall (R-KS), and Tommy Tuberville (R-AL). 


Altogether, eight Republican Senators voted in objection. Should they have been allowed to sit on the jury? If they were excluded, only 61 votes would have been needed to convict. 

## The Oath is a Sham

The Senators take an oath before the trial. Here’s what the Constitution says about it.

> #### Article I, Section 3, Clause 6 
> The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. **When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation**. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.

(emphasis mine)

The [Constitution Annotated](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S3-C6-1-3-2/ALDE_00000709/) has this to say about the oath.

> The Senate practice has been to require each Senator to swear or affirm that he will “do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.” 

Before Trump’s first impeachment, numerous Republicans including Senate Majority leader, and Yertle the Turtle impersonator, Mitch McConnell said, “I'm not an impartial juror. This is a political process. There's not anything judicial about it.”

During the second impeachment, Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, Mike Lee, and Ted Cruz met privately with Trump’s defense team, both before and during the trial. Senator Rand Paul could also be seen talking to the defense during the trial.


If Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Mike Lee (R-UT) were excluded for meeting with the defense team prior to the trial,  only 90 Senators would reamin on the jury and only 60 would be needed to convict. Maybe three other GOP Senators would have voted to convict, if this were the case. *And maybe rainbows will fly out of my butt.*

## A Fix

Rather than having the whole Senate vote, which reduces impeachment to party-line vote, the Senators could nominate six Republicans and six Democrats to sit as the jury. If the vote were taken in secret and still required a two-thirds majority, impartial justice might be done.

But this would require a constitutional amendment, which requires a two-thirds supermajority vote in both the House and the Senate. *Put some monkeys on the rainbows.* 

## So far, Impeachment is 0–4

Like the Minnesota Vikings in the Super Bowl, impeachment has a perfectly imperfect record, four attempts, zero convictions. 

* In the first Trump impeachment, Mitt Romney voted guilty on one of the articles of impeachment, abuse of power. *The votes were 48 guilty to 52 not guilty on abuse of power, and 47 to 53 on obstruction of congress.*

* When Bill Clinton was impeached he also faced two articles of impeachment, perjury (lying to a federal grand jury) and obstruction of justice. All 45 Democrats in the Senate voted to acquit on both articles. Ten Republicans voted to acquit on perjury, and five on obstruction of justice. *The votes were 45 guilty — 55 not guilty on perjury, and 50—50 on obstruction.*

* Back in 1868, in the impeachment trial of Democratic President Andrew Johnson, there were eleven articles of impeachment, but only three ever received a vote in the Senate. There were only 54 Senators at the time, and only nine Democrats. (Ten former Confederate states did not yet have representation in the Senate.) All three votes were 35 to 19 in favor of impeachment, just one vote shy of the 36 needed for conviction. In all of these votes, the same ten Republicans joined the nine Democrats in a not guilty vote.

* Richard Nixon was never formally impeached. Three articles of impeachment, obstruction of justice, abuse of power and contempt of Congress, were voted out of the Judiciary committee, with seven of the seventeen Republicans joining all twenty-one Democratic members. Impeachment in the House was a certainty and conviction in the Senate likely. But before that happened, Nixon released a transcript that made it clear he was complicit in the cover-up. At this point, even his most vocal defenders in Congress abandoned him and Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.


## What will get a President Impeached?

From the Constitution:

> #### In Article II, Section 4
> The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

(Apparently, you could put a comma, pretty much, anywhere you wanted to, back then. And capitalize any Noun, like a Trump tweet.)

Arguably Trump could have been impeached for Treason, but it’s a tough get. Treason is defined very narrowly in the constitution.

> #### In Article III, Section 3, Clause 1
> Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open court.

In the few cases tried “levying war” has been interpreted as “engaging in armed combat against” and the “two witness” statement has been taken literally.

Other than bribery, that leaves “high crimes and misdemeanors.” But, what qualifies? Looking at the previous attempts, we see:

* Johnson was impeached for firing the secretary of war, in violation of the newly passed  Tenure of Office Act. Most historians now think the act was unconstitutional and Johnson should not have been impeached. 

* Nixon would have been impeached for his part in the cover-up of the break-in at Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate building. They broke in to photograph documents and install listening devices in telephones. They tried to rig the 1972 election, which Nixon won. The scandal took a long time to break, and he resigned midway thru his second term in 1974.

* Clinton was impeached for, essentially, lying about and covering up a sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was initially accused of sexual harassment by Paula Jones. After Ken Starr was appointed Independent Counsel, he went on fishing expedition looking for any wrong-doing. 

* Trump’s first impeachment was based on the charge that he solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election. He tried to strong-arm Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to dig up dirt on Hunter Biden and Joe Biden, who was the presumptive Democratic nominee. 

* Trump’s second impeachment arose out of the attack on the Capitol. A crowd of Trump Supporters assembled at the Save America  rally, and then headed to teh Capitol, where the killed a cop, injured 140 others, broke in and chanted "Hang Mike Pence" and "Where's Nancy."

## Can a President be Impeached after Leaving Office? 

About this, the Constitution says:

> #### In Article I, Section 3, Clause 7
> Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honour, Trust or Profit under the United States; but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law

Since several Judges have been impeached after resigning, it would seem that removal is not required, and the Senate voted on this twice. 

* On January 26, 2021, Rand Paul tried to force a floor vote on the constitutionality of impeaching a President after their term. Paul's motion was killed on a 55–45 vote, with five Republicans joining all Democrats.

* On February 9, 2021, the Senate voted on the motion “Is Former President Donald John Trump Subject to a Court of Impeachment for Acts Committed While President?” The vote passed 56–44. 

Bill Cassidy changed his vote after hearing evidence in the impeachment trial. This is the precedent they set: a President can be impeached after leaving office.

## How likely is a conviction?

* Nixon was messing with the election, and it evolved an actual break-in and illegal wiretapping. He would have been impeached, and probably removed, had it gone to a vote.

* Clinton was impeached for lying to Congress. The closest vote was on the article of obstruction of justice, a 50 – 50 vote. None of his alleged crimes actually featured in the trial.

* Trump 1 involved election tampering without any overtly illegal actions. Just one “perfect” call. All the shit Guiliani was up to in Ukraine, which is just starting to come out, looks corrupt, but nobody got beaten or killed, nor were any overt illegal acts presented in the impeachment trial. The closest vote was on the article of abuse of power, a 48 – 52 vote. 

* Trump 2 involved an attempted coup, and a cop was killed, so plenty of crime. Also, Trump looks likely to face prosecution for his attempts to strong-arm Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, to “find 11,780 votes” and flip the States’s election. 

A President is more likely to be impeached if they are tampering with an election, or holding on to power. Crimes and cover-ups increase the odds of impeachment and the number of guilty votes should it happen, but the odds of conviction have more to do with the partisan make-up of the Senate than any other factor.
