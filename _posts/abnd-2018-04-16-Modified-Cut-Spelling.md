This post applies modified version of [Cut Spelling][cut] to the previous post, about the difficulties of English spelling. Becuase it is very meta.

I'm applying a subset of the rules of cut spelling:

1. Cut letters irrelevant to pronunciation. This rule deletes most silent letters, except when these letters (such as "magic e") help indicate pronunciation. Examples: peace → pece, except → exept, plaque → plaq, pitch → pich.
2. The digraphs *gh* and *ph* become *f* when pronounced. Examples: laugh → laf, sulphur → sulfur, photograph → fotograf.
3. The letter *g* is changed to *j* when pronounced with a soft *g* or *zh*. Examples: judge → juj, beige → beij .
3. The combinations *ig* and *igh* are changed to y when pronounced with the long *i*. Examples: flight → flyt, sign → syn.

The rest of this post will use the this modified spelling.


## English Spelling is Caotic Evil

English spelling is a yard sale. It is hyly irregular. The way words are written bears little relationship to how they ar pronounced. This makes lerning to read more difficult, and spelling a challenj.

Not all languajs work this way. Spanish, for example, is much mor regular. It has a much closer relationship between pronunciation and spelling. In Spanish, each letter or combination of letters, makes a single sound.

## Examples of Strange English Spelling

Look at how many ways the letters “ough” can be pronounced:

* through (ryms with ‘shoe’)
* dough (ryms with ‘go’)
* bought (ryms with ‘shot’)
* drought (ryms with ‘out’)
* rough (ryms with ‘stuff’)
* cough (ryms with ‘off’)

There ar six different pronunciations. It’s arbitrary. The only way to lern these pronunciations is to memorize them. This is one of the worst examples in English, but these are all common words. 

In the new system, these words wud be spelled:

* thru
* doh
* bot
* drout
* ruf
* cof

The “ough” example shos how one set of letters can be pronounced differently, but the opposite problem also plages English. Look at all the different ways that the short “e” vowel sound can be spelled.

* red 
* bread
* said
* many
* bury
* friend 
* guest
* l*eo*pard
* *ae*sthetic

The last two ar odd spellings of uncommon words, but that is a wide variety of spellings for one of the most common vowel sounds in the languaj. 

In the new system, these short "e" words wud be spelled: 

* red 
* bred
* said
* many
* bury
* frend 
* gest
* lepard
* esthetic or estetic

The spelling long vowels is even stranger. The following is a list of words pronounced with the long “o” sound.

* road 
* bone
* go
* toe
* though
* low
* sew
* bur*eau* (French loan word)
* brooch (ryhmes with coach)

The last two ar unusual spellings, but all the others ar common words. The words “low” and “sew” have ambiguus pronunciations. They myt rym with “how” and “dew” rather than having the long “o” sound.

In the new system, these long "o" words wud be spelled: 

* road 
* bone
* go
* toe
* tho
* lo
* sew
* bur*au* (French loan word)
* brooch 

## How Did We Get Here

The rules for English spelling wer [codified around 1470][mid]. The languaj at this time was very different. We now call it Middle English. But wile the spelling has been mor or less fixed for the last five hundred years, pronunciation has changed dramatically. For example, the languaj went thru the [Great Vowel Shift][shift], wich changed the pronunciation of all of the long vowels.

Additionaly, English has a large number of “loan words” borrowed from other languages. Many of these retain their original spellings.

Essentially, Modern English spelling captures the pronunciation of a much older language, combined with the spellings of loan words imported from other languages. Yep, that's a dynamite plan.

### More Sounds than Letters

There are about 44 phonemes in English, or 44 different sounds. Our alphabet has only 26 characters. There are more sounds than letters. Some phonemes are spelled using combinations of letters, like the “sh” sound in “shop,” but even these are not regular. The same phoneme is spelled differently in words like “action” and “sugar”.

As a result, there are multiple ways to spell nearly every phoneme. And most letters have multiple pronunciations depending on their position in a word and the context.

## Wat Can Be Don About This?

There have been many attempts to reform English spelling. Most of these failed because they wer too radical. If the system tries to fix too many problems, it changes the spelling of most words. This is a non-starter. It would require everyone learning to read all over again.

Here is an example of [Cut Spelling][cut], a modern reform effort:

> Th Space Race was th competition between th United States and th Soviet Union, rufly from 1957 to 1975. It involvd th efrts by each of these nations to explor outr space with satlites, to be th 1st to send there a human being and to send mand and unmand missions on th Moon with a safe return of th humans to Erth.

And an example of [SoundSpel][snd], a reform effort from 1910:

> It was on the ferst dae of the nue yeer the anounsment was maed, allmoest siemultaeniusly frum three obzervatorys, that the moeshun of the planet Neptune, the outermoest of all planets that wheel about the Sun, had becum verry erratic.

Examples like these are wy spelling reform has generally been regarded as the work of harmless crackpots. *([Benjamin Franklin's proposed reform][ben] added letters to the alphabet, a truly crackpot idea.)*

There have been some successful reform efforts, like the one championed by Noah Webster. His first dictionary, published in 1806, contained [an essay advocating for changes to English spelling][web]. These spelling changes — with “color” and “center” replacing “colour” and “centre” — became the basis for American English spelling as distinct from British. He also Webster didn’t invent these spellings, he merely popularized them.

### Principles for Spelling Reform

I have played around with a number of alternate spelling systems and most of them, including some I have devised, are pretty much bat-shit insane. But I think the successful reform efforts have some things in common.

* They are modest. Rather than trying to solve every problem, they focus on a small number of changes.
* The new spellings shorter than those they replace.
* The new spellings have unambiguous pronunciations.
* They avoid changing the spelling in a way that obscures the root meaning of the word or collides with an existing word. Changing “might” to “mite” is confusing because the word “mite” already exists. 
* They often embrace alternate spellings that already exist but are not in wide use.

In my writing, I use some non-standard spellings:

* thru
* tho
* altho
* nite
* tonite
* lite

The following seem like good candidates, altho I don’t use them regularly.

* luv instead of love
* ruff instead of rough
* tuff instead of tough
* laff instead of laugh 

There are a hole host of words that end in “ve” that would be pronounced the same with the final “e” dropped. English has very few words that end in “v”. Some of these would seem to be good candidates:

* hav instead of have
* giv instead of give
* liv instead of live 

The last change, “live” to “liv” would help distinguish this from the word “live,” meaning alive or happening now.
