My background is in technology. My Degree is in English. Let me put both to work for you.

## The Game Plan

1. Learn about your audience. Who they are and what they want.
1. Understand the tone you want to project.
1. Identify your goal. Are we educating or persuading? What does a win look like?
1. Write the piece. Edit it. Get your feedback. Revise it. Repeat until you are happy.

## Pricing

<span class="type">**Base Rate**</span>         <span class="rate">10¢ a word</span>   <span class="total">$70 for 700 words, $100 for 1,000</span> 
<span class="type">**Research Required**</span> <span class="rate">15¢ a word</span>   <span class="total">$105 for 700 words, $150 for 1,000</span>
<span class="type">**Highly Technical**</span>  <span class="rate">30¢ a word</span>   <span class="total">$210 for 700 words, $300 for 1,000</span>

Those categories are fairly subjective, but <a href="#contact" class="cta">we’ll start with a conversation</a> and agree on a price up front. 

If you’d prefer an hourly or project rate, no problem. We can work that out. 

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

If you are blogging as part of a content marketing strategy, SEO is an important consideration. I have a good grasp of the basics. For example, [this post](/posts/presenting-mulitple-design-options) currently ranks second on google for the search “[presenting multiple design options](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=presenting%20multiple%20design%20options).”

There are a lot of factors that affect ranking, and I can’t promise that your post will be on the first page of results. But I will maximize your ranking, and I understand which details matter most.
