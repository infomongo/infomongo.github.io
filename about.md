# About John	
	
I’m John Phillips, a UX designer and writer. [I have been designing products for more than fifteen years][ux]. I design web and mobile apps, and desktop software. 

I got started in UX at [Quark][q], back when QuarkXPress was a thing, and we were better at PostScript than Adobe. *(At the time, it was futuristic to have _very silly_ capitalization.)*

Much of my work has been in [local search][loc]. I have designed store and ATM locators. I lead the design of an [Agent Locator for Nationwide Insurance][nw]. Before that, at Local Matters, I designed sites for many of the leading yellow page companies in Europe.

My [LinkedIn profile][li] shows my work history and recommendations.
