Hello. Iâ€™m John Phillips, a UX designer and writer. [I have been designing products for more than fifteen years][ux]. I have designed web and mobile apps, and even desktop software. I got started doing UX design for [Quark][q], back when people used QuarkXPress. *(That was back when software was actively murdering capitalization.)*

Much of my work has been in [local search][loc]. I have designed store and ATM locators. I lead the design of an [Agent Locator for Nationwide Insurance][nw]. Before that, at Local Matters, I designed sites for many of the leading yellow page companies in Europe.

My [LinkedIn profile][li] shows my work history and recommendations.
