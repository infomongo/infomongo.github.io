<p class="narrow">My background is in interaction design. This is the practice of making software easy to use. It starts by understanding the people using it, who they are what they want. A well designed tool approaches the problem from the user’s perspective. My approach to writing is similar. <!-- What is the goal of the post? Who are we seeking to persuade or inform? Similarly, clear writing uses language familiar to audience, whether seeking to educate or persuade. --> </p>
	
<h3>The Game Plan</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Learn about your audience. Who they are and what they want.</li>
	<li>Understand the tone you want to project. <!-- : light-hearted or serious, topical or evergreen. --></li>
	<li>Identify your goal. Are we educating or persuading? What does a win look like?</li>
	<li>Write the piece. Edit it. Get feedback from you. Revise it. Repeat until you are happy.</li>
	<li>Promote the post on social media and <a href="/posts/">my blog</a>. <em>(Unless I ghostwrite it for you.)</em></li>
	<li>Send you an invoice, which I hope you’ll pay promptly.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Pricing</h3>

<ul class="pricing">
	<li><span class="rate"><strong>Base Rate:</strong> 8¢ a word</span> <span class="total">$56 for 700 words, $80 for 1,000</span></li>
	<li><span class="rate"><strong>Research Required:</strong> 15¢ a word</span> <span class="total">$105 for 700 words, $150 for 1,000</span></li>
	<li><span class="rate"><strong>Highly Technical:</strong> 30¢ a word</span> <span class="total">$210 for 700 words, $300 for 1,000</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="narrow">
	<p>Those categories fairly subjective, but <a href="#contact" class="cta">we’ll start with a conversation</a>  and agree on a price up front. If you’d prefer an hourly or project rate, we can work that out, too.</p>
	
	<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
	
	<p>If you are blogging as part of a content marketing strategy, SEO is an important consideration. I have a good grasp of the basics. For example, <a href="/posts/presenting-mulitple-design-options">this post</a> currently ranks second on google for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=presenting%20multiple%20design%20options">the search “presenting multiple design options.”</a></p>
	
	<p>I can’t promise that your post will be on the first page of results. There are a lot of factors that influence ranking, many outside of our control. But I will work to make your post rank as highly as possible. And I understand which details matter most.</p>
