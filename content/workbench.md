## Placeable Workbench

I was the Lead UX Designer for [Placeable][1] Workbench, a SAAS Location Data Warehouse product. This app allows large brands to get the most out of their location data. It helped them find and fix problems in their data. Usability of the app consistently rated highly by users.

I worked closely with product management to identify and design features. I built an early  prototype of the app to validate the concept and guide development. I also created wireframes, comps, and did front-end development on the product.
