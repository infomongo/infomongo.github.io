### Placeable Workbench

I was the Lead UX Designer for [Placeable][1] Workbench, a SaaS Location Data Warehouse product. This app helped large brands to find and fix problems in their location data. Usability of the app consistently rated highly by users.

I worked closely with product management to identify and design features. I built an early  prototype of the app to validate the concept and guide development. I created wireframes, comps, and also did front-end development.
