## Store Locators
	

At [Placeable][1] we created a platform that allowed us to quickly build store locators for our clients. I did the UX design of the templates used in the system. These were “skinned” with the site‘s branding. I was also part of the engineering team that built the system.
	
Sites built on our platform combined top-tier usability with best-in-class SEO.

Some example sites:

* [Smashburger][2] – We created this locator for the brand in 2014.
* [Big Lots][3] – A locator for the discount retailer. Search for Denver, CO or click the link “Browse by State”.
* [UMB Bank][4] – A branch and ATM locator for this bank. Try searching for Hartford, CT. 

The branding and graphic design were done by others. I did the UX design of the base templates, including the flow between pages and information hierarchy.
