### Bigger Brands

In addition to the standard templates, clients could choose to fully customize the sites. Bigger brands often went this route.

* [Nationwide Insurance][1] - I worked with Nationwide’s excellent UX team to design this Agent Locator.  The basic flow is similar to the sites above, but it also supports searching by name and provides a wealth of details about each location. The mobile version of this site is slightly simpler, as our research revealed different use cases for mobile users.
* [Western Union][2] – This one was designed by their in-house team. The mobile variation uses the standard designs I developed.
