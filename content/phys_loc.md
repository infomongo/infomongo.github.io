### Physician Locator

[Moonsault Software][1] built this site for a large insurance company.

The brief was to create a tool to help insurance agents sell to a predominantly elderly population. Business rules at the insurance company organized the physicians into different groups. A doctor could belong to multiple groups, but each patient could enroll in only one. The challenge was to provide a way to visualize these networks, so the agent and customer could find a group that included the doctors the customer wanted.

The design we settled on combined a physician locator with a shopping cart. You could search for a doctor and save them. You could filter by speciality, language spoken and other physician properties. The cart page highlights the groups that saved doctors have in common, and displays a warning if there arenâ€™t any. 

I designed the app and did front-end development. The project had an aggressive timeline, 6 weeks from start to finish.
