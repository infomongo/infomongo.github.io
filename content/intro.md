## Hello & Welcome

Iâ€™m John Phillips. My background is in UX and interaction design. I have been designing products for more than 15 years, including mobile apps, web sites and desktop applications.

I have been working with HTML and CSS for almost as long. I specialize in clean, minimal, responsive code.

I am also [a writer](/posts/). My BA is in English and I have been doing various kinds of technical writing for most of my career.

I enjoy creating prototypes. They are a quick way to explore an idea and get a feel for it. They are fantastic for usability testing and as developer documentation.
