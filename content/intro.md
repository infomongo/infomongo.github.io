Iâ€™m John Phillips, a UX Designer & Web Developer with 15 years experience designing and building for the web.

I enjoy creating prototypes. They are a quick way to explore an idea and get a feel for it. I use a couple of tools to speed up the process: [Jekyll][1] a ruby framework for creating static sites and [Angular JS][2] a JavaScript framework for creating applications.
