<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="dublin-off"></div>
		
<p>I‘m John Phillips, a UX Designer &amp; Web Developer with 15 years experience designing and building for the web.</p>

<p>I enjoy creating prototypes. Prototypes are a quick way to explore an idea and get a feel for it. I use a couple of tools to speed the process up: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> a ruby framework for creating static sites and <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular JS</a> a JavaScript framework for creating applications.</p>

<p><label class="links" for="switch"><input id="switch" type="checkbox"> Open links in a new window.</label></p>

<h2>Angular Apps</h2>

<p><b><a href="http://scout.placeable.com">Location Scout</a></b> – This app is a sales tool. It provides prospects and sales people a way to check a brand‘s local data. Try entering Starbucks or another national brand. I did the design a code on this one, although it is calling an internal API that is doing much of the heavy lifting. This got built pretty quickly, less than a month working off and on.</p> 

<p><b><a href="http://roi.placeable.com">ROI Calculator</a></b> – Another sales tool, this one estimates the ROI of Placeable‘s offereings. I did the UX Design and much of the engineering, adapted from an existing project. Total dev time for this project was about 2 weeks.</p>


<h2>Store Locators</h2>

<div class="locator-off"></div>

<p>At <a href="http://placeable.com">Placeable</a> we created a platform that allowed us to quickly build store locators for our clients. I did the UX design of the templates used in the system. These were “skinned” with the site‘s branding. I was also part of the engineering team that built the system.</p>

<p>Some example sites:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://locations.smashburger.com">Smashburger</a> – We created this locator for the brand in 2014.</li>
	<li><a href="http://local.biglots.com">Big Lots</a> – A locator for the discount retailer. Search for Denver, CO or click the link “Browse by State”.</li>
	<li><a href="https://locations.umb.com">UMB Bank</a> – A branch and ATM locator for this bank. Try searching for Hartford, CT. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these sites has a mobile version, try visiting them on your phone.</p>

<p>The branding and graphic design were done by others. I did the UX design of the base templates, including the flow between pages and information hierarchy.</p>


<h3>Bigger Brands</h3>

<p>In addition to the standard templates, clients could choose to fully customize the sites. Bigger brands often went this route.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://agency.nationwide.com">Nationwide Insurance</a> - I worked with Nationwide’s excellent UX team to design this Agent Locator.  The basic flow is similar to the sites above, but it also supports searching by name and provides a wealth of details about each location. The mobile version of this site is slightly simpler, as our research revealed different use cases for mobile users.
</li>
	<li><a href="http://locations.westernunion.com">Western Union</a> – This one was designed by their in-house team. The mobile variation uses the standard designs I developed.</li>
</ul>
