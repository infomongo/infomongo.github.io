<h2>About Me</h2>
		
<p>I‘m John Phillips, a UX Designer &amp; Web Developer with 15 years experience designing and building for the web. On the twitter, I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/infomongo">@infomongo</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoy creating prototypes. Prototypes are a quick way to explore an idea and get a feel for it. I use a couple of frameworks to speed the process up: <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> a ruby framework for creating static sites and <a href="https://angularjs.org">Angular JS</a> a JavaScript framework for creating applications.</p>

<h2>Apps</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://roi.placeable.com">ROI Calculator</a> is a simple application created using Angular. I did the UX Design and much of the engineering, adapted from an existing project. It’s a simple marketing tool rather than a prototype, but it shows capabilities of Angular. Total dev time for this project was about 2 weeks.</p>


<h2>Store Locators</h2>

<p>At <a href="http://placeable.com"></a>Placeable we created a platform that allowed us to quickly create store locators for our clients. I did the UX design of the templates used in the system. These were then “skinned” with the sites branding. I was also part of the engineering team that built the system.</p>

<p>Some example sites:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://locations.smashburger.com">Smashburger</a> – We created this locator for the company in 2014. The site also has a mobile version, try visiting it on your phone.</li>
	<li><a href="http://locations.vigoglobal.com">Vigo Money Transfer</a> – We created the locator for this subsidiary of Western Union. Try searching in Denver, CO or Mexico City.</li>
	<li><a href="https://locations.websteronline.com">Webster Bank</a> – A branch and ATM locator for a regional bank. Try searching Hartford, CT. This also has a mobile version.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these sites the branding and graphic design was done by others. The UX design, the flow between pages and infomation hierachy is</p>


<h2>Bigger Brands</h2>

<p>In addition to the standard templates, clients could choose to fully customize the sites. Bigger brands often went this route.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://agency.nationwide.com">Nationwide Insurance</a> - I worked with Nationwide’s excellent UX team to design this Agent Locator.  The basic flow is similar to the sites above, but it also supports searching by name and provides a wealth of details about each location. The mobile version of this site is slightly simpler, as our research revealed different use cases for mobile users.
</li>
	<li><a href="http://locations.westernunion.com">Western Union</a> – This one was designed by their in-house team. The mobile variation uses the standard designs I developed.</li>
</ul>
